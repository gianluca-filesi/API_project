# API_project
This project's aim is deploying a web app to predict a car price basing on historical data.

In the notebook, the statistical model is trained and test and the pickle model to be used in the api is created.

In app:
- main.py is used by Render to launch the webapp
- main_local.py is used to tun the app locally
- fastapi.py is the API in backend
